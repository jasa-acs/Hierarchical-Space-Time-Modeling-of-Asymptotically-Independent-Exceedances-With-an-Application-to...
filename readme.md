# Hierarchical Space-Time Modeling of Asymptotically Independent Exceedances With an Application to Precipitation Data


Data 
----


Data set in the paper consists of hourly observations at 50 rainfall stations for
the years 1993 to 2014 in the mountainous areas of the Cevennes and the
Alps (France). Extreme rainfall events usually occur during fall season;
therefore, our application considers only observations from the
September to November months. Elevations at gauge sites range from 140
to 1000 meters. Data have been extracted from the database of the French
Met Office, Météo France.

The data cannot be freely distributed, but access can be requested to Météo France for academic purposes. 

Data can be downloaded from the following web interface of
[Météo France](https://publitheque.meteo.fr/okapi/accueil/okapiWebPubli/index.jsp)
site.

To obtain the stations used in the application study in our manuscript,
the following identifiers of measurement sites must be requested:

Third-party code 
----

We follow

Hughes, G. B., and Chraibi, M. (2012), *Calculating ellipse overlap
areas*, Computing and Visualization in Science, 15, 291--301.

in order to efficiently calculate the ellipse intersection area.

We used selected part of the code from [their repository](http://github.com/chraibi/EEOver), namely 

Roots3And4.c, solvers-2.c, solvers.h, config.h, program_constants.h



Instructions for use 
----

Code has been tested on a workstation running a Linux OS


1\) Install the [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)  library. 

For instance under a Linux Debian
distribution, open a terminal and type

sudo apt-get install libgsl0ldbl libgsl-dev

For Mac users, please follow the instructions [here](http://macappstore.org/gsl/) 

2\) Compile the source files and then link all specified object files into a shared object

For instance under  Linux OS open a terminal and type

R CMD SHLIB spt-gamma.c zsolve_quartic.c solvers-2.c Roots3And4.c
-L/usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu -lgsl -lgslcblas



3\) file simulation-gamma.R contains the code for a simulated example. To run this 

R CMD BATCH simulation-gamma.R
